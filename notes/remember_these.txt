5.	Array creation : CITIES=("Bangalore","London","Delhi")
6.  Array elements accessing syntax : ${array_name[index]}
7.	CITIES=("Bangalore" "Delhi" "Raipur" "London") is correct

9.  To access all elements : ${CITIES[*]} ... ${CITIES[@]}
10.	$?, $*(Single line o/p), $@(Separate lines o/p) ... printf

	Correct =>  while [ $index -le $n ] 
14. Don't forget to include ==> fi ...otherwise
