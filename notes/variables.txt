Types => basically 3 types ... 1)local variables, 2) environment variables, 3) shell varibles

Special variables => 	$0(script name), 
						$?(exit status of previous command), 
						$1, 
						$*, 
						$@, 
						$#(no. of parameters),
						$!(process number of last bg command), 
						$$(process number of current shell, for shell script, this is the process ID under which they are executing)

1.	Scalar variable(1 value at a time)
	NAME = "Malinikesh"
2.	PI=3.14
	readonly PI
	PI='Pi'				#Error

3.	PI=3.14
	echo $PI
	unset PI 			#Remove from list of varibales that shell tracks(it won't work for readonly)
	echo $PI 			#blank
